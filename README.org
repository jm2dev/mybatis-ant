* MyBATIS and ANT

A project to play with relational databases using mybatis and ant.

Inspired by
https://github.com/midpeter444/MyBatis-UserGuide-Companion-Code.git

** Dependencies

- MySQL database
- ANT
- IVY for dependencies
- TestNG: Comment out the "testng" definition and run "ant resolve" to
  get it.

** TO DO

I tried to set up slf4j - logback, but not sure it is working.
