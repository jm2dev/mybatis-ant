A project to play with relational databases using mybatis and ant.

Inspired by
https://github.com/midpeter444/MyBatis-UserGuide-Companion-Code.git

Spanish cities MySQL database:

** Dependencies

- MySQL database
- ANT
- IVY for dependencies
- TestNG: Comment out the "testng" definition and run "ant resolve" to
  get it.

** TO DO

runant.osx is a script to simplify my setup in osx. In fedora linux
with ant and ivy intalled via packages, no problem, just call ant.

I tried to set up slf4j - logback, but not sure it is working.
